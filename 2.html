<h3>WEB이란 무엇인가?</h3>

<img src = "Stroberry.jpg" width="25%">
<p style = "margin-bottom:30px;" /p>
<p style = "margin-top:45px;" /p>

<p>Ok, so this is the only bit of mandatory theory.</p>
<p>In order to begin to write HTML, it helps if you know what you are writing.</p>
HTML is the language in which most websites are written.
HTML is used to create pages and make them functional.</p>
<p>The code used to make them visually appealing is known as CSS
and we shall focus on this in a later tutorial.
For now, we will focus on teaching you how to build rather than design.</p>
